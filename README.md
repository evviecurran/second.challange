Working with CSS and HTML to make a website interactive

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project is a profile made using CSS and HTML. There are links connected to the toggles on the navigation bar which brings the users down to the selected aspect. I was able to create an interactive website with the help from a tutor, Juan Delgado, he walked me through the different steps on how to create such website. Especially he told me to just keep trying different ideas so I can see what will happen.

HOW TO USE PROJECT: The site is interactive and when certain things are click you are given that information

I plan to add more to this website as I learn more about different coding techniques. I plan to have this website more interactive with more projects included.

LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT I was able to understand parent elements and how to use nav/class/div Able to create a website using various colors and fonts
